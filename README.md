# Shakti_riscv_hal
****This crate is hardware abstraction layer for Shakti's C-class PARASU,PINAKA and E-class VAJRA processor which is riscv architecture.****


The Shakti processor is an open-source initiative by IIT Madras, dedicated to developing production-grade processors, System on Chips (SoCs), and development boards. It includes a SHAKTI-based software platform. This hardware abstraction layer (HAL) provides a Rust SDK for the Shakti RISC-V architecture, facilitating the execution of secure and memory-safe code on Shakti chips. To delve deeper into usage and implementation details, the Shakti Rust Book serves as a comprehensive resource, including insights into utilizing the Shakti_riscv_hal crate

## How to use this hal

[Shakti Rust Book]() : 
The Shakti Rust Book serves as open-source documentation for the Shakti Rust SDK repository. It provides comprehensive information, guides, and documentation for developers looking to utilize the Shakti RISC-V hardware abstraction layer and run secure and memory-safe code on Shakti family chips using Rust. This resource is openly accessible to the community for learning and contributing to the development of Shakti-based projects.
