# Shakti_riscv_hal
****This crate is hardware abstraction layer for Shakti's C-class PARASU,PINAKA and E-class VAJRA processor which is riscv architecture.****


The Shakti processor is an open-source initiative by IIT Madras, dedicated to developing production-grade processors, System on Chips (SoCs), and development boards. It includes a SHAKTI-based software platform. This hardware abstraction layer (HAL) provides a Rust SDK for the Shakti RISC-V architecture, facilitating the execution of secure and memory-safe code on Shakti chips. To delve deeper into usage and implementation details, the Shakti Rust Book serves as a comprehensive resource, including insights into utilizing the Shakti_riscv_hal crate
